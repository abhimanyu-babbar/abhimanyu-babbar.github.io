Iâ€™m Abhimanyu Babbar. I reside in quiet neighbourhood in Aundh Pune, Maharashtra. I am passionate about developing scalable systems and writing good quality maintainable code in the process. I am currently working as a **Distributed Systems Engineer** in Platform9.

I created this blog as a way to start my journey towards getting my voice out in this world. This blog shall contain ramblings about events in my life along with the learnings associated with them. It will also act as an achor regarding the tech learnings and gotchas I pick up on my way to become a better software engineer.

Outside work, I love reading mindset and motivational books and incorporate learnings in my life. Other than that, I love playing badminton with friends on the weekend and watching anime in free time. Currently, watching **Boku No Hero Academia Season 4**.
