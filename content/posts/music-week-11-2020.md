1. **Daniela Andrade** - Stare at Each Other & Fall in Love

   This song feels like such an intimate song. The creator makes you feel like a person watching through her webcam and gives a peek into her lifestyle. The smoothness and the subtleness of her voice is simply amazing.

2. **Daniela Andrade** - Genesis

   It all started with this song. I stumbled upon her music through this song which played at an event. I know it at that time that I had to shazam it. The choreography in this song is so rustic but still it makes such an impression on you.

3. **Daniela Andrade** - La Vie en Rose

   A while ago, I picked up guitar as a side hobby. It never became a serious passion for me but I still have this idea at the back of my head to learn some tasty guitar licks. So, this song from her is a perfect song to learn as it doesn't have too many chords or transitions between them.

4. **Midnight** - Los Angeles

   This song to me has such a nostalgic feel to it. The lyrics are amazing. To me it feels like they are an underrated band. They should be having more shows and followers.
