For this week, I found new sound nuggets which I would like to share with you all


1. **Divine** - Sher Aaya Sher

   I got introduced to _GULLY BOY_ songs pretty late but man o man they are a force of nature. I specially like this song and the rap.

2. **Gryffin** - Nobody Compares to You

   This is such a goody good song. I have been following Gryffin for sometime now and this song I feel has the right melody, bass and drums.

3. **The Paper Kites** - Don't Keep Driving

   This song was a result of me aimlessly searching youtube and I think I landed on this song using the autodiscover feature of youtube.

4. **Mild Orange** - Some Feeling

   This song I discovered during my regular shuffling of lofi hip hop beats on the internet. I was struck by guitar tunes in this song and thus it made this list. Give it a try ?!
