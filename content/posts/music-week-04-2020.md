While working on my side projects and at work, below songs are the ones I have been listening to on a regular basis. Hopefully, you find a gem or two in here:

1. **Bishop Briggs** - River

   It's an uplifting track I think. I like how the song is shot.

2. **Faime** - Rain

   This one is a beauty here. Such a nice melodic tune, makes you wanna just sit and relax.

3. **LÉON** - Treasure

   She is such a talented singer. I love most of her songs but this one has some really nice notes in it and it is just amazing.

4. **BLAEKAR** - Pretty Awkward

   Time and again, this songs makes my list. It's such a peppy tune that I love it. Nice vocals and good melody, what else we need in a song right ?

5. **BLAEKAR** - All the Memories

   Heard this song in one of Irfan Junejo Vlogs. If you haven't checked him out on youtube do so. I think he is really good and also the song is by BLAEKAR. How can it not be good ?!
