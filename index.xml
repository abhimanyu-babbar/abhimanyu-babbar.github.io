Divine - Sher Aaya Sher
I got introduced to GULLY BOY songs pretty late but man o man they are a force of nature. I specially like this song and the rap.
Gryffin - Nobody Compares to You
This is such a goody good song. I have been following Gryffin for sometime now and this song I feel has the right melody, bass and drums.</description></item><item><title>Music Week - 04 - 2020</title><link>https://abhimanyu-babbar.github.io/posts/music-week-04-2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 12:07:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://abhimanyu-babbar.github.io/posts/music-week-04-2020/</guid><description>While working on my side projects and at work, below songs are the ones I have been listening to on a regular basis. Hopefully, you find a gem or two in here:
Bishop Briggs - River
It's an uplifting track I think. I like how the song is shot.
Faime - Rain
This one is a beauty here. Such a nice melodic tune, makes you wanna just sit and relax.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://abhimanyu-babbar.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 13:36:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://abhimanyu-babbar.github.io/about/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
